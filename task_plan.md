# Task Plan - Selenium Java to Playwright (JS/TS) Converter

## Project Overview
Develop a converter that transforms Selenium Java test scripts into Playwright JavaScript/TypeScript test scripts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Protocol 0 - Initialization
- [x] Create project memory files (`task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`, `gemini.md`)
- [x] Answer Discovery Questions
- [x] Define Data Schema in `gemini.md`
- [ ] Get approval for the Blueprint

### Phase 1: B - Blueprint (Vision & Logic)
- [x] Research Selenium to Playwright conversion patterns (TestNG specific)
- [ ] Define mapping rules (Selectors, Actions, Assertions, Annotations like @Test, @BeforeMethod)
- [ ] Design the UI mockup (Input area, Output area, Conversion logs)
- [ ] Design the conversion pipeline logic

### Phase 2: L - Link (Connectivity)
- [x] Set up development environment (Node.js + Express)
- [x] Verify connectivity to Ollama API
- [x] Create Single-file Premium React UI (Bypassing version issues)
- [ ] Test conversion with Qwen model

### Phase 3: A - Architect (The 3-Layer Build)
- [ ] Layer 1: Architecture (Define conversion SOPs)
- [ ] Layer 2: Navigation (Decision making for conversion logic)
- [ ] Layer 3: Tools (Python/Node.js scripts for parsing and generating code)

### Phase 4: S - Stylize (Refinement & UI)
- [ ] Refactor generated Playwright code for best practices
- [ ] (Optional) Develop a simple UI for uploading/pasting Selenium code

### Phase 5: T - Trigger (Deployment)
- [ ] Finalize documentation
- [ ] Set up CLI or Web trigger for conversion
